Metadata File Structure

Repository description:
R scripts and data for the Strawberry Guava Project, which analyzes how guava invasion affects canopy structure, seedling and plant communities, invertebrates (pitfall, malaise, sticky traps), and soil properties in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar.
